# Final Project Repository

Welcome to my final project repository! This project focuses on addressing the 
prediction problem of

## Project Structure

`data/` : Contains datasets used in the project
`figures/`: stores visualizations and figures generated during the project
`rscripts/`: contains all of the associated rscripts for the project
`memos/` : holds associated memos to see how I progressed through the project
`results/` : contains the tuned and final data and models associated with the lab (change this later)

## Documents

`Nelson_Chelsea_executive_summary.html` : Executive summary document in HTML format.

`Nelson_Chelsea_executive_summary.qmd` : Quarto source document for the executive summary.

`Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.html` : Final project report in HTML format.

`Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.qmd` : Quarto source document for the final project report.

## Usage
If you want to explore or run the code, I would recommend starting with 
`rscripts/1_initial_setup.R` to understand the distribution and layout of the 
original data and then running in order after that in order to see the 
development and creation of the different types of models. I would finish off
by looking at `rscripts/4_model_analysis.R` to see how each model performs, 
looking at which has the most accuracy. Otherwise, all of the associated model 
data, fitted data, tables of the performance analyses, and the recipes in which
I created can be found in their respective rscripts. 

Additionally, however, if you would just like a quick overview of my project, 
I would recommend reading through both `memos/Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_1.html` 
and `memos/Nelson_Chelsea_progress_memo_2.html` as well as 
`Nelson_Chelsea_final_report.html` for a complete overview of my project, 
from start to finish. 

If you would just like a quicker overview of the main insights 
generated from my project, I would recommend reading through 
`Nelson_Chelsea_executive_summary.html` as that is a short executive 
summary of all the work and insights that I gained from my work.

## Acknowledgments
I call any external libraries used at the top of each 
rscript file if needed throughout looking through my progress.
