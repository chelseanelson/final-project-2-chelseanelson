## Recipe Overview

`baseline_rec.rda`: kitchen sink recipe/preprocessing for parametric models (e.g. logistic regression, neural network)

`baseline_naive_bayes_rec.rda`: kitchen sink recipe/preprocessing for baseline naive bayes model 

`baseline_tree_rec.rda`: kitchen sink recipe/preprocessing for tree-based models (e.g. random forest,
boosted tree, $k$-nearest neighbors)

`feature_eng_tree_rec.rda`: feature engineered recipe/preprocessing for tree-based models (e.g. random forest,
boosted tree, $k$-nearest neighbors)

`feature_eng_rec.rda`: feature engineered recipe/preprocessing for parametric models (e.g. logistic regression, neural network)
