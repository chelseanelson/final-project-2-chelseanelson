## Assessment Metric 

## Analysis Plan

- Data Splitting
- Resampling Technique
- Model Types
- Amount of recipes 
- Need to map this out in Github Repo as well, with place holder R scripts 

## Have Two Model Types Defined and Fitted 

- Null Model 
- Other Model Type (Linear or Logistic Model)
- Demonstrate their fits are successful by displaying a table that contains each model's assessment metric value 

## Summary of Progress 

- where they are at 
- what next steps will be 
- identifying and potential issues or concerns
